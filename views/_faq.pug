    p.text-justify
      | When you sign in to #[+project-name], we ask for permissions to access some of your data on GitHub.
      | We need such permissions to provide you the list of your organizations and repositories so
      | that you can enable #[+project-name] on any of your repositories in a simple manner.
      | We automatically setup #[+project-name] on your repositories as soon as you "start" using #[+project-name]
      | on them. Reviewers get assigned on your behalf. Let's review the different "scopes" (the
      | term used by GitHub to sort the different permissions you can grant to applications like
      | #[+project-name]):
    p.text-justify
      ul
        li
          | We ask for the #[code user:email] scope to retrieve your email address and create
          | #[a(href='/account') your account] on #[+project-name]. You can update your information whenever
          | you want, and all the information we read from your GitHub profile are displayed;
        li
          | To show you all of your repositories, including the ones from any organization you’re part of,
          | we need the #[code read:org]. The GitHub API hides any organizations
          | you’re a private member of without this scope. So to make sure we show
          | you all of your repositories, we require this scope. We cannot read the data or code of your
          | repositories with this scope;
        li
          | Getting reviewers on your projects with #[+project-name] is as simple as enabling it and
          | waiting for a new Pull Request. We take care of the rest. The #[code write:repo_hook]
          | scope allows us to create and update a webhook so that #[+project-name] is notified from GitHub
          | on new Pull Requests;
        li
          | #[strong If you include private repositories], then we need the #[code repo] scope.
          | We need this level of access because GitHub does not provide the equivalent of
          | #[code read:org] scope for private repositories.
